A Chrome Extension Built in Vue, with the purpose of making people's job search slightly less tedious by enhancing the standard filtering options of job sites.

Currently consists of a popup window for configuring blacklists for keywords in the job title and company name. 

Only works for uk.indeed.com, but designed to be easily extendable to other websites with minimal effort.
